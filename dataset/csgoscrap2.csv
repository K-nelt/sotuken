Dedicated Counter-Strike players invest substantial time in acquiring knowledge, resulting in continuous personal growth. In Global Offensive, progression holds immense significance, particularly for newcomers or those returning after a hiatus. This unyieldingly intense, skill-driven first-person shooter compels players to adopt a distinctive mindset unlike that of contemporary shooters. If you hail from the Call of Duty realm, adapting your gameplay style becomes imperative for success in Counter-Strike. Furthermore, Counter-Strike endeavors to evolve by implementing slight changes, while remaining faithful to its core strengths. By revamping familiar maps and introducing fresh official modes, Global Offensive revitalizes the gameplay, offering veterans new challenges and encouraging novel play styles—a remarkable feat after nearly 15 years of the franchise's existence.""]",1058,0

There's no interraction with the fanbase of the game that made Valve and Steam what it is today, and that's very disappointing for me. Valve own such a fantastic product but appear to have lost sight of their roots and where all their success came from. The development of the game has lagged behind and if not careful will quickly become the way of the Blackberry (I was going to say DoDo but thought BBerry was just the same and applicable!). Why has there not been greater advancement of the Source platform to take better advantage of today's gaming PC horsepower and reinvigourate a community that's becoming quickly displeased with the lack of communication as to the games direction, as well as current play-ability, variety and lack of transparancy? If Valve have no intentions of investing the required resources and money into developing this sleeping giant of games into something that will see an explosion of interest, praise and thanks from the gaming community as a whole then...why not sell it to someone who will take it forward with purpose fans like me are crying out for???

Why won\'t Valve introduce an age bracket market for trading etc. that requires Government official Photo ID Age verification that removes certain restrictions like trading for and returning real money etc.? There\'s so much potential there, the market history proves that, so why not consider offering more than one type of service? It\'s a little shortsighted from ValSteam to not consider their market demographics are as varied as the number of games on sale in their store and have never really persued any course of action to capitalize on those different market segments, or maybe you are, or, maybe you\'re just dealing with so much legal backlog from the ""loot box"" gambling situation?!?!?! Who know\'s? Certainly nobody in the community, why? No communication. Is it because you don\'t think you\'re client base are capable of comprehending the current situation or is it because the majority of your client base are 15 and under and you don\'t consider that a worthwhile demographic to answer to? A closing comment on this particular aspect of the review...Valve/Steam...please remember that every year that client base grows, so does the diversity of age and the growing expectations from a community you yourselves helped build, so be prepared and be willing to change or you too, will go the same way as the Blackberry DoDo.', ""Anyway, CS is a great game and I'll always play it and just like every place in this world, both real and virtual, you will find the majority of people are good and don't cheat, but you also get the least desireable of people you find everywhere too and thankfully, like everywhere else, they're the minority."", 'Cheers', 'Chris', 'P.S.

On ESEA the ranking isn't **AS** broken as matchmaking and the community on ESEA takes the game pretty seriously and don't mess around, which I really like that, however the problem is that it is a paid suscription which not everyone is willing to pay, so there's also FACEIT which provides the same service as ESEA but for free, however Faceit has premium features but payment is not obligated to play."", 'So, the game is pretty much the same, not many fixes or changes going on, but I wanted to update this review since these third-party services change the game experience dramatically and make the game generally more enjoyable, so give those a try and they make help you like the game a little more, at least it worked for me.', '-Datsuke 05/05/2018', '  - ̗̀ Datsuke ̖́-', '768 products in account', '20', '159 people found this review helpful', '42 people found this review funny 27', 'Recommended', '1,315.8 hrs on record', 'Posted: December 31, 2022', 'Awesome game, aside from loads of cheaters.

It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators."", ""The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was.

Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever."", ""There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO.

Since CS:GO requires alot more tactics than most other shooters, aim is more important aswell. Having your crosshair at the right position means you can take your opponent down alot faster. Alot of practice, and playing aim maps helps and using your sound to locate your enemy's footsteps gives you a big advantage. The CS:GO Esports scene is also massive, milions of people follow it and it's a great place to learn. Use this to your advantage. Wanna know those new tactics, boosts and smoke/flashes?

Once you get a bit higher you'll see the community gets better and better(with the occasional toxic/clueless player ofcourse). People work together, people give usefull information and are just a bit more nice in general."", ""Next to competitive, CS:GO also has some game-modes for people who just want to have some fun and don't care about ranks or tactics.

This is all to say that somehow, despite being almost a decade old, CS:GO remains one of the most popular titles on PC as a whole, beating out such rivals as Apex Legends, Valorant, Warzone, PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege, and pretty much every other FPS game you can let roll off the tongue, and likely any non-shooter title you can think of as well. I would venture to say that no game aside from Minecraft and PONG has had even remotely close to the staying power of CS:GO.', ""All that said, the game blows. Modern CS:GO looks dated, sounds dated, and plays like Valve's 1998 Half-Life. Source has completely knee-capped any opportunity for growth and innovation, and with a few minor meta changes and the introduction of new gamemodes and weapons, CS:GO is the same game now that it was 3,500 days ago. Some would argue that this is a sign of perfection, of effortless staying power, but I would argue that it is a sign of a lazy cash grab. Let's be honest, in comparison to modern competitors, CS:GO's movement is incredibly clunky. You can draw a direct lineage between crouch-jumping mid-doors on Dust II to completing puzzles in Black Mesa in Half Life. CS:GO is likely the only game about using firearms that does not allow you to ADS and more or less guarantees the user that the bullets coming from their firearm will not hit what they are looking at unless they have perfect movement, aim, and spray-pattern knowledge. Very few weapons have been added in the last decade, and those that have been added are generally worse in every measurable way to those that they replace. Dust II remains the most popular map and has itself only seen a light graphical upgrade with only a small handful of map design changes. New maps are introduced, regularly complained about, and removed from the current map pool. If you are reading this in 2032, Dust II is likely still the most popular map and likely remains un-upgraded."", 'Socially, the game is terrible. The vast majority of the user base is either incredibly toxic, racist, cheating, or a combination of all three. The way that matchmaking works, it is easy to come across smurf after smurf after smurf, losing game after game after game to players who\'s real skill is likely 10x higher than CS:GO placed them. I cannot begin to count the number of games in which I was subjected to player\'s profile pictures that were outright pornographic or I was called racial or homophobic slurs. ""Toxic"" does not even begin to describe how inhumane the CS:GO community can be at times.', 'So thus far, I have established that CS:GO is one of the most popular games on PC that has time and time again outlasted better competitors, I have dogpiled the game for looking, sounding, and playing like a game from 1998, and I have called all of the userbase toxic cheaters. If I believe all of these things, how can I possibly recommend the game? Easy - I only play CS:GO with friends. I play for fun and to collect skins. Many an hour has been spent, three or four beers deep, just chatting and joking with friends with CS:GO on in the background. Three, four, or even five-stacking pub matches is incredible fun. Playing the game in a public lobby where you and your friends work through elaborate, practiced routines of memes and jokes with poor, unsuspecting randoms is easily one of the funniest things you can do with a microphone and PC. Stupendous fun can be had when you find a player who has a sense of humor who will joke around with you as much as you with them. Every game is a win when you play with friends - you either lose the game so that your skill rating drops and you get to pub stomp the next lobby, or you win the game and your skill rating increases so that you can get pub stomped next game, thus setting you up for your own pub stomp. This circuitous motion is what keeps the game fun and fresh, you either get dumpstered on, dumpster a team, or the CS:GO matchmaking works for once and you have to fight for your life to get that 15:15. CS:GO sucks as a game, and you will never, ever see me playing it alone. But as a medium by which you can interact with your friends, CS:GO is unbeatable. Put a 30-rack in the fridge, get some T-Bell delivered, and get four friends who cannot hit the accept button with their aim and I guarantee you will make a life-long meme between the five of you.']",1,0

This is somewhat lengthy, so it is really down to you whether or not you actually decide to read it all."", ""So, where do I begin? Well, after reaching the second highest matchmaking rank (Supreme Master First Class) in October 2015 and continuing to play CS:GO from there on throughout 2016, I can say I've had a lot of experience with the game. In that time, I've clocked 1.3k hours and have seen a lot of changes. It's funny really, when I consider the very beginning. For my very first MM rank, I successfully achieved Silver 1. That day I was so excited, only to find out it was the lowest rank there is. Yeah, that sort of sucked. That's not something that deterred me though, because back then, I found enjoyment out of the game and saw a lot of potential that made me want to fight to the top."", ""So, what exactly happened which took that enjoyment away? During 2016, I continued to play competitive CS, that being through regular MM, Faceit or even some ESEA. The difference from 2015-2016, is that in 2016, I began to often take breaks. These 'breaks' often came as a result of several angry occasions where I was confronted by the issues surrounding CS. Those issues are mostly the obvious ones everyone knows about, such as the increasing amount of cheaters, lack of necessary updates, hit registration, community etc."", ""The issues are something I wish to look more deeply into. Alongside hit registration, there is the problem of accuracy as a whole. The fact that you can have an AWP positioned on a players head and somehow 'miss' the shot, yet a player can running headshot you with a pistol is just insane. Further speaking about cheaters, there is the fact nothing is done to truly stop them. The developers of the game are greedy and they know how cheaters can be of benefit to them. When the time comes for a cheater to finally get banned, they can just go pay to get the game once more on another account. Within an hour or so of being banned, they are straight back. That's not the only instance of them being greedy. Take the graffiti update as an example. Instead of focusing on the game breaking issues, they add paints. Now, this brought a lot a nostalgia. Of course though, the first paint you recieve is awful and you have to go purchase more in order to have something that looks good. The limited use feature that prevents you having a graffiti spray for more than 50 uses just further proves of how hungry they are for money. A last point I wish to mention, is that I cannot forget about the unbelievably toxic community. I do respect this one is difficult to control though."", ""Even despite all these game problems, I always managed to return to CS:GO. The reasons for this, as follows, were boredom, the fact that I was not too bad of a player or after I watched a Pro/YouTuber perform really well. These factors gave me the naive idea that I could once again gain enjoyment out of the game. That idea was soon shattered every time, when I was reminded of the state of the game and how it hasn't improved on any of the given issues. Huge attention comes to the game through the eSports scene or the regular community, however nothing changes."", 'In order to put an end to the cycle I got myself in of leaving and returning, I promised to quit CS:GO for good in order to enjoy other games and activities outside gaming. I certainly had a fun time in playing CS:GO, however the increasing issues, lack of attention towards issues and the fact the communities voice is not heard, has currently killed the game for me. Who knows where things will go in the future with this game? I hope things may look up.', 'Side note - I find it very amusing that so many of the positive reviews are full of content that is negative about the game.', 'TL;DR - Quit CS:GO because of cheaters, greedy developers, toxic community, accuracy issues, lack of motivation etc.', ""In an attempt to avoid any comments calling me 'hypocritical', although I will still most likely receive them, I am adding this update. Just now, I have reinstalled CS, this now being a month down the line since having it uninstalled. Whilst I have got the game back again, this review is still relevant as my views about the game have not really changed. The simple reason for me getting this game once more, is the fact I have been requested by many to play. Through requests, I have made the choice to maybe play with some friends here and there if they need the extra player. Chances are my enjoyment on the game will still be low and I do not intend to play this game regularly."", '  Tea Abuser', '168 products in account', '102', '536 people found this review helpful', '47 people found this review funny 1', 'Not Recommended', '1,289.6 hrs on record', 'Posted: October 19, 2017', ""CS:GO, I mean the game itself is very fun but there is a huge issue that makes the experience so terrible. Once you reach a decently high rank in matchmaking that is Legendary Eagle Master and above, 60% of the games you will proceed to play will be against cheaters. These cheaters use paid cheats of at least ($40USD) per month; and they bypass overwatch by closet cheating, which means they hide their cheats by trying to look legit. This allows them to bypass overwatch as they hide their cheats quite well and make their shots look as if it was all luck. I myself have been queued against cheaters 8 games in a row in LEM-GE matchmaking. Because of stuff like this I've started moving onto other games such as Overwatch (the game from Blizzard). I actually enjoy CS:GO more than Overwatch but the game is filled with cheaters in the higher matchmaking ranks that ruins the experience for people like myself. The situation is actually disgusting, where we now have people who queue with cheaters in order to gain a high rank, because at this point if you want to reach and maintain GE you either queue with cheaters or become one; at least in the Oceania scene of matchmaking. And I forgot to mention that this is in Prime matchmaking, which is supposed to be fairly safe. These cheaters also have groups where they admit to cheating, even inviting more people to join them and play matchmaking while they either boost them or cheat together. CS:GO as a game is great, but I really hope Valve puts a hold on adding new skins all the time and actually makes a decent anti-cheat which bans all those external software users. Many people suggest ESEA, but there are people like me who have no interest of going pro or playing at tournaments in the future, ESEA is for people who are serious and dedicated to the game; for those who are looking to be a step ahead. I'm just a normal player who enjoys the game, I'm not looking to go big in CS, so I do not see why someone like myself would need to pay to play a legit game of ranked CS:GO. What's funny is a third party matchmaking client has a better anti-cheat than a multi-millionaire company like Valve. The VAC waves of one cheat are not enough. There are many other cheats out there and new ones are made all the time. I really like this game but at this point I feel like quitting due to stuff like this. This is why for now I won't recommend this game; not unless Valve at least manages to actually fix this issue.""]",2,67

It is a stand-alone follow-up to the famous Counter-Strike mod from Half-Life where terrorists battle the Counter-Terrorists on different locations.', 'Gameplay & Story: 6/10', 'The gameplay consists of buying weapons and shooting your opponents. Easier said than done actually, since your opponents are either human players sitting on the other side of the world wide web or some AI programmed to shoot you first. CS:GO is for a reason the biggest competetive shooter on the market for years, since it offers great weapon balance, tactical possibilities for teams to approach and a large player base that keeps growning each day. The story behind the game is based on the oldschool Counter-Strike game, where one side takes the approach as terrorists either trying to plant a bomb or protect the hostages and other being Counter-Terrorists either try to protect a bomb site or trying to rescue the hostages held at Terrorist base.', 'The combat is absolutely fluid in CS:GO and there are barely any moments, that you could blame the broken hitboxes or the bad netcode for dying. People tend to rage and blame the bad balance on maps, weapons or programming of the game, however the success of this title proves that it is the best competetive shooter on the market. The challenge in this game is definetely to be able to rise through the ranks in competetive matches, playing against hackers on opposite team or some players on your team that want to teach you some bad words in russian or french. I am always thankful for such opportunities to improve my language skills and consider it just a chance of becoming even better if I did not win the match no matter the team stacks. Reaching Global Elite rank after around 200 hours, I can safely say that it is possible to rise to the top even when the odds are stacking against you.', 'The graphic when set to higher settings is actually pretty good, sadly the competetive scene barely allows it since there are certain tricks like setting your resolution lower on purpose to be able to aim better, that crash the feeling of this game in graphical matters. Most of the maps contain some details that make them distinguishable, like certain grapphiti on some maps. The interface is kept simple and almost transparent so that it does not disturb the concentration.', 'It is possible to consider progress by rising up the account level that comes from simply playing CS:GO in any form, there are forms of rising up your ranking by playing competetive or gathering skins for the weapons you are using or want to sell. Some people actually make money by playing this game and selling the skins on the steam market, so different ways to progress in and outside of the game. The biggest progress for me was improving my hand-to-eye coordination by playing it competetively.', 'Each weapon sound is unique for itself, and since the sound plays a great role in this game it is really important to get to know the sounds and be able to distinguish where the shooting is coming from. CS:GO fulfills its task really well. The music is played only in menues and during the highlights. The game music is nothing special, but since you can get/buy music kits to fit your music taste, Valve found a good workaround for not creating amazing music by themselves.', 'CS:GO has its reasons to be the Number One FPS in the ESL Scene and its popularity is currently only rising. It is great to see that it has not been abandoned by the developers after reaching its peak state, but still keeps getting updated. I would recommend trying CS:GO to every game, just to know what this game is that defines the global FPS market so much and while FPS fans might love it, some might well get turned off by the hardcore players or the cursing and spitting wanna-bes.', 'I hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying and installing this game.

As you can tell, this game serves many different ideas, strategies, preferences and possibilities to each and every person who are against each other."", ""And yet another great thing to note is that this game gets multiple, yet fast updates.

This led me to creating a steam account. I really enjoyed CSS and even got into a group of experienced players. Every weekend we would all get together with other semi competitive groups to play against each other. Fast forward a decade after lots of health issues and family problems I started getting back into video games and come to find out about Counter Strike Global Offensive. Seeing the new and improved versions of the maps and bombsites we used to spar for really kick-started my interest in playing again.
